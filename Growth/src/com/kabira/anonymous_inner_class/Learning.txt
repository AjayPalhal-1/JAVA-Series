1. What is an Anonymous Class?
   An anonymous class is a **class without a name** that is created to extend a class or 
   implement an interface for one-time use. It is written directly inside a statement.

2. Why Use It? 
   Anonymous classes are useful when you need to quickly add or customize behavior for a
    single instance without creating a separate class.

3. How Does It Work? 
   - It can override methods of a superclass or provide implementations for interface methods.  
   - It can access variables from the enclosing class or method.  

4. What Canâ€™t It Do? 
   - It cannot define its own **constructors** or **static members** (like static variables or methods).  
   - It cannot be reused elsewhere because it has no name.
   - we can accesses static member and method in it 

5. Where Is It Used?
   Commonly used in **event handling**, **callbacks**, or other situations where a quick, custom 
   implementation is needed.
