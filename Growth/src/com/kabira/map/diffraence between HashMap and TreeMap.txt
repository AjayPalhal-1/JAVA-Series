1. **HashMap**:
   - Order: Does not guarantee any order of the keys.
   - Purpose: Efficient for lookups, additions, and deletions.
   - Use Case: When order of elements does not matter.
   - Behavior: The order might appear random due to the hashing mechanism.
   - Key Point: The order of elements in HashMap can vary, even though it might appear 
     sorted in some cases (as seen in your example).

2. **TreeMap**:
   - Order: Automatically sorts the keys in natural order (ascending for numbers, alphabetical for strings).
   - Purpose: Use when you need sorted keys.
   - Use Case: When you need keys to be in a sorted order.
   - Behavior: Always provides sorted output of keys, regardless of the insertion order.
   - Key Point: Sorting is guaranteed, making it useful for maintaining a natural order of keys.

3. **LinkedHashMap**:
   - Order: Maintains insertion order of the keys.
   - Purpose: Useful when the order of insertion needs to be preserved.
   - Use Case: When you need to maintain the order in which elements were added.
   - Behavior: Outputs elements in the order they were inserted, unlike HashMap.
   - Key Point: Keeps the insertion order, unlike HashMap and TreeMap.

Key Differences:
- HashMap: No order guarantee, fast for general usage.
- TreeMap: Sorted keys in natural order.
- LinkedHashMap: Maintains the insertion order of keys.

Conclusion:
- Use HashMap when you don't care about the order of elements.
- Use TreeMap when you need keys to be sorted.
- Use LinkedHashMap when you need to preserve the order in which elements are added.
