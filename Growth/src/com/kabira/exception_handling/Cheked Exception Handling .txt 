Checked  Exception : 

so we can say that the exception which may predicted by developers and 
if they want to handle it they need to write thier own cutome / 
user defind excption to handle it for writing sepcial class of that 
excption they need to extend Exception which provide nesccary things
and why they need to extend exception coz its predicatable and can 
solved be developer

 

- Exceptions that are **predictable** (like age validation, file handling, or database
  operations) and require developers to handle them explicitly are best suited as 
  **checked exceptions**.  
- To create a custom exception for such scenarios, you need to **extend `Exception`**, 
  as this enforces compile-time checking and makes handling the exception mandatory.  
- This ensures developers write specific logic to handle these predictable issues effectively.
